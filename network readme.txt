Thanks! Jared R. Dmello, Ph.D. It's a javascript library called D3 that has nice interactive data visualization. I started with a basic example (something like this https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph-component) and then asked chatgpt for help in customizing it. My friend Philipp Burckhardt recommended claude.ai, which helped some too. Then I created the html network, and I put it in github to read it from my website using iframe. You can see my code for the network here: https://github.com/mariacuellar/networks
